We have 2 part under Avalon2, AR9331 the host side, LM32 the fpga side

AR9331:
  * Do we need multi-pool? I think we do.
  * We need api, pool management, stratum code, a lot.
  * So I think we need the cgminer
  * I will start keep patches here, patches for OpenWrt.
  * It will goes to public repo unitl we have real hardware. mean all open source


The protocol:
  * Use serial-serial for controller connection
  * Send task change to broadcast stratum task
  * we support 3 controllers
  * Command format:
  **  (0x00 ~ 0x87) AR9331 --> FPGA: 就一个：newtask,
  **  (0x88 ~ 0xff) FPGA --> AR9331: 有两个：resend + 心跳
  **  format：HEAD(0x55aa) + CMD(1byte) + LENGTH(2bytes) + DATA + CRC(1byte) TAIL(0x77ff)
  **  newtask: 0x00, reset: 0x88, heartbeat:0x89

Memo:
* How to sync?
* 8MB Uboot and Firmware
* GPIO control the PSU
* Sync with OpenWrt
* About the serial console? kernel will use /dev/ttyS0 when start
* The new Avalon2 driver for cgminer
