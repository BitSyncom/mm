* MM version: 331406-35fef7040
* Turn on the red led when the module id was match.

2014-05-27
* MM version: 331406-fe02da80
* Add code for turn on red LED
* When all those two temperature sensors bigger then 90C. power off ASIC.
* Clean old local works when get detect message
* Add one quick poweroff self test, indicator by red LED.
* Known Iusse: All modules(connect to one usb-serial port) red led will blinking when turn on any one of them

2014-05-04
* MM Version: 331404-dbb0c7c0
* Support newest ADP board
* Fixed a typo on read temperature
* Change default modules count from 3 to 4

2014-04-17
* MM Version: 331404-b191ace0
* Add ASIC core test code, host application is avalon3-a3233-modular-test.py
* Fix the power good shifter, it is binary format. 0x1F mean all 5 power module are good.

2014-04-01
* MM Version: 331404-ed2bbc80
* When temp > 90C. MM will power off all ASICs
* Make the Avalon3 MM 100% compatible with Cgminer Avalon2 code
* Please use the Avalon2 703n/RPi firmware after 2014-03-20. the firmware will support both Avalon2(A3255) and Avalon3(A3233). PLEASE NOTICE
**  The voltage range is different
**  Voltage: 0.6v ~ 0.8v
**  The frequency is Mhz not MHs under Avalon3. so the range is
**  Frequency: 400MHz ~ 650Mhz (MHz * 11.81 = MHs)
**  For example: if you config the Frequency to 400 under Avalon3 that mean 400 * 11.81 = ~4.7GHs
